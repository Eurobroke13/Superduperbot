# Superduperbot — Claude Session Context

## What this project is
A crypto futures paper-trading bot running on OKX perpetual swaps. It detects market regime (bull/bear/sideways), scores trade candidates using technical indicators, gets Claude AI approval for higher-conviction entries, and manages exits via graduated stop-loss/take-profit logic.

## Railway Services Architecture

There are 6 services in the `patient-analysis` Railway project (`production` environment):

| Service | Type | Schedule | Command | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Superduperbot** | Always-on server | Every 15 min (internal) | `npm start` → `node server.js` | Main bot: full regime refresh, scoring, Claude approval, exits |
| **superduperbot-runner** | Cron | Every 2 min | `npm run task:fast-scan` | Fast scan: exit checks + auto-only entries between main runs, NO Claude calls, NO regime refresh |
| **superduperbot-weekly** | Cron | Sundays 08:00 UTC | `npm run task:weekly-review` | Weekly performance report to Telegram |
| **superduperbot-trade-a...** | Cron | Sundays 08:00 UTC | `npm run task:trade-analysis` | Trade breakdown report (setup/approval/signal stats) |
| **superduperbot-premarket** | Cron | Daily | `npm run task:premarket` | **DISABLED in code** — premarket case is a no-op in task-runner.js |
| **apply-seed-job** | One-off | Manual | `node backtest.js --seed-safe` | Seeds regime/signal stats from backtest data |

**Important:** `superduperbot-premarket` still fires on schedule but does nothing — the `premarket` case in `task-runner.js` is commented out. Consider removing this service.

**Railway config-as-code (June 2026):** The root `railway.json` hardcodes `startCommand: "npm start"`, and every service that deploys from this repo inherits it — which silently overrides each service's dashboard start command. This is why the runner kept launching the full server. The fix is a **separate `railway-runner.json`** (runs `npm run task:fast-scan`, no `/health` healthcheck since it's a cron worker, not a web server). The runner service must point its config-file path at `railway-runner.json` in Railway Settings → Config-as-code. The main **Superduperbot** server keeps using `railway.json` (`npm start`). Do NOT change the `startCommand` value in the shared `railway.json` — it would break the main server.

### How main bot and fast-scan runner coordinate
- Main bot (15 min): loads state → refreshes regime → fetches news → scores 50 contracts → Claude approval → saves state
- Fast-scan runner (2 min): loads state → uses **cached regime** → scores batch → **auto-approves only** (no Claude) → saves state
- **Postgres advisory lock** (`withBotLock` in `db.js`) prevents them running simultaneously — if the main bot is mid-run when the cron fires, the fast-scan skips that cycle with `[LOCK] Another bot run is active — skipping this run`

## Telegram Notifications (`bot/telegram.js` → `notifyTrade`)

Every position event pushes a Telegram message. Action types:
- **OPEN** — new entry (direction, entry, SL, TP, score, reasons)
- **CLOSE** — full exit (exit price, reason, PnL)
- **PARTIAL** — TP1/TP2 partial close (% closed, exit price, PnL)
- **TRANCHE** — T2/T3 scale-in fill (added margin, fill price, total, new avg, SL) — *added June 2026; previously only console-logged*
- **DCA** — averaging into a drawdown position (fill price, new avg, margin)

---

## State Management

All bot state lives in a single JSONB blob in Postgres (`bot_state` table, key `bot_state_v1`). Every `saveState` call rewrites the entire blob. Trades are also written to a separate `trades` table atomically in the same transaction.

**Key state fields:**
- `positions` — open positions map (symbol → position object)
- `trades` — last 500 closed trades (loaded from trades table on startup)
- `cash` — available paper cash
- `lastRegime` — cached regime (label, hmmLabel, piCycle, markovProb, refreshedAt)
- `cooldowns` — post-TP and overbought-SL cooldown expiries per symbol
- `_pendingTrades` — trades closed this run, flushed atomically on saveState
- `tokenUsage` — Anthropic API token counts for budget tracking
- `regimeStats` / `signalStats` — adaptive threshold inputs

---

## Claude API Configuration

- **Model:** `claude-sonnet-4-6` (set in `bot/config.js` → `CLAUDE_MODEL`)
- **Budget:** $40/month soft cap (`MONTHLY_BUDGET_USD`); hard stop at $38 (`checkBudget` in `claude.js`)
- **Fallback:** `CLAUDE_LIMIT_FALLBACK` — thrown when Anthropic returns a spend-limit error; bot falls back to auto-approval mode (score ≥ 5 threshold)
- **Error detection:** Only actual spend-limit messages trigger fallback. Other API errors (400, model errors, etc.) now log the full error text as `[CLAUDE] API error 400: ...` instead of silently falling back — check Railway logs if Claude stops working

**As of June 2026:** Claude spend shows $0.09 of $40 budget used, but the API was consistently returning errors. Root cause not yet confirmed — deploy the error logging fix and check Railway logs for `[CLAUDE] API error` to see the real error message.

## Strategy Tuning (June 2026 — "strategy hardening" pass)

Six deliberate changes to improve edge. Each was sanity-checked; watch scan logs
after deploy to confirm they fire at sane rates.

1. **Signal weight de-bias** (`config.js`) — `liquidity-bear` 0.0→0.5, `OBV-bear-div` 0.0→0.3 to cut structural long bias. **`trap-vol-bear` deliberately left at 0.0** — `adaptation.js` force-disables it every run, so changing it is a no-op.
2. **DCA confirmation** (`execution.js` → `checkDCA`) — loss-scaled: requires **4/5** confirmations normally, **5/5** once >2 ATR underwater. Plus a hard veto: never average in when both MACD momentum AND VWAP value oppose the position. Log tells: `(X/4 confirmations, loss Y.Y ATR)` and `Vetoed: core trend (MACD+VWAP) against position`.
3. **Explicit TP3 target** (`exits.js` → `checkGraduatedExit`) — final 40% books at **5.5× ATR** (`tp3-target`) instead of trailing out for minimal gain. Structured `pos.tp` takes precedence when nearer; trailing SL still updates every call as the floor. Legacy in-flight positions without `tp3.price` gracefully fall back to trailing.
4. **Mean-reversion concurrency cap** (`runner.js` → `phaseScan`) — max **2** concurrent MR positions (open + this run's picks). Excess rejected with `mr-concurrency-cap`.
5. **Correlation cluster gate** (`scoring.js` → `checkCorrelationExposure`) — max **2** same-direction positions per cluster (majors/L1/L2/memes/AI/DeFi). Additive to the existing 7-per-side and 60%-exposure caps. Reason: `cluster <name> already has 2 longs/shorts`.
6. **Time-decayed adaptive learning** (`adaptation.js` → `buildSignalStats`/`updateDynamicWeights`) — exponential **10-day half-life** on each trade's contribution to WR/EV, so recent structure dominates stale history. **Raw sample counts** still gate the min-sample thresholds (count<20 skip, ≥25 disable), so thin recent data can't disable/boost a signal alone.

## Known Issues & History

### Fixed
- **Daily Telegram summary spam** — `maybeSendDailySummary` used an in-memory date variable that reset on every Railway restart, sending a new summary each time. Fixed by removing the daily summary entirely (user only wants weekly report). `server.js`.
- **Stop-loss same-run re-entry churn** — After a stop-loss, the symbol was immediately re-eligible for entry in the same 15-min cycle. Fixed by building `slThisRun` set from `_pendingTrades` and excluding those symbols from `tradeable` filter. `bot/runner.js`.
- **Claude error detection swallowing real errors** — `invalid_request_error` was being caught as a budget-limit signal, causing silent fallback to auto-mode for ANY 400 error (wrong model, bad request format, etc.). Now only actual spend-limit messages trigger `CLAUDE_LIMIT_FALLBACK`. `bot/claude.js`.
- **Duplicate bot instances** — `superduperbot-runner` was running `npm start` (full server) instead of `npm run task:fast-scan`, causing two complete bot instances scanning and trading simultaneously. **Root cause:** the shared root `railway.json` hardcodes `startCommand: "npm start"`, which overrode the runner's dashboard setting. **Final fix:** dedicated `railway-runner.json` + point the runner's Railway config-file path at it (see Railway Services Architecture above). Earlier dashboard-only changes kept getting overridden by `railway.json`.
- **Race condition between services** — Main bot and fast-scan runner shared Postgres state with no coordination. Fixed by adding `withBotLock` (Postgres advisory lock) in `db.js`, wrapping every `runBot` call. `db.js`, `bot/deps.js`.
- **Tranche fills not notified** — T2/T3 scale-ins were only console-logged, never sent to Telegram. Fixed by threading `notifyTrade` into `checkTranches` and adding a `TRANCHE` message type. `bot/execution.js`, `bot/telegram.js`, `bot/runner.js`.

### Active / Ongoing
- **DRIFT WARNING** — Last 100 trades: WR 42%, EV $1.64, PF 1.09, DD 8.6% — all below baseline (WR 43.6%, EV $4.03, PF 1.52, DD 3.5%). Likely contaminated by the duplicate-instance period (two bots racing on shared state). Expected to recover as clean single-instance trades roll the bad ones out of the 100-trade window. The June 2026 strategy-hardening pass (see above) also targets the underlying edge. Re-evaluate after ~150 clean trades; if still drifting, it's a real bear-regime strategy issue.
- **Claude API errors** — See above. Deploy error logging fix and check Railway logs.
- **SLX-USDT-SWAP / IRYS-USDT-SWAP partial candles** — These symbols consistently return fewer candles than requested (SLX: 56/200 on 4H, IRYS: 85/200 on 4H). New listings with limited history. Bot skips them correctly but they appear as noise in logs.
- **`superduperbot-premarket` service** — Still running on schedule but does nothing (disabled in code). Wastes a Railway service slot — consider deleting it.
